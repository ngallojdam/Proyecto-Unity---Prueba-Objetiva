As I had already indicated in my [previous repository] (https://github.com/ngallojdam/My-first-project-in-Unity). This is my first experience in Unity.

### Full stack example with Unity

This project is a simple Unity game where players (the white ball) can jump and collect items, while running away from enemies and avoiding obstacles.
The game is developed in C# and Unity and features sound effects for actions such as jumping and collecting items, as well as stage scoring and total score as long as you are playing and do not exit the game.
The difference with the previous installment is that I am asked to work with virtual reality. I will try!!!!!

### Getting started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
As you know, neither GitHub nor the Unity cloud allow hosting large amounts of data, which is why the entire game itself is
hosted on my Google Drive, whose link is: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ue-QB3SdZ3FLxQWnXXM4IkxsvlwSToCY?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l60Ex58atefQW0UkL04bYZiw6UrSLQtt?usp=drive_link)
hosted on my Google Drive, whose link is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ue-QB3SdZ3FLxQWnXXM4IkxsvlwSToCY?usp=drive_link

As you can see, the game consists of three phases (minigame, minigame1, minigame2). In each of them there are a series of elements that you must
collect, avoiding obstacles and enemies.
You will win the game if you manage to overcome all three phases.
GOOD LUCK!!!
